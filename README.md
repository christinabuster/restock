This is a system that can be used for tracking inventory and warehouses. A user can have many warehouses and keep track of all their inventory for each warehouse location. For my project I have started the beginning of an inventory template application that can be used for any business in need of digital organization.

How to use this app:

1. After setting up (with Replit or Github) open your browser to localhost:3000
(This proect is present on both Replit and on Github)

2. Create one or a few warehouses

3. After creating a warehouse click on new item at the bottom of the page.

4. Fill out the new item form. The last field is a drop down that allows the user to select a warehouse location. 

5. After clicking submit the item is saved to a specific warehouse location.


Future feature implementations will be:

1. Adding incoming wholesale orders to update inventory when new shipment arrive and outgoing orders/customer purchases.

2. Create low inventory alerts for when inventory is getting close to selling out.

3. Create purchase orders when a user gets a low inventory alert.

4. Creating a product reports feature to see how fast inventory moves and how much each item grosses in a period of time.
